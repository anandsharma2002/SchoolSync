# Database Structure

This document provides a thorough analysis of the database model, EF Core migrations, schema, relationships, authentication/authorization wiring, and controller endpoint access across the repository.

- Backend: ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8), EF Core, PostgreSQL
- Auth: ASP.NET Core Identity with `Guid` keys + JWT (bearer in cookie)
- DbContext: `SMSDataContext.Data.DataContext`
  - Inherits: `IdentityDbContext<ApplicationUser, IdentityRole<Guid>, Guid>`
  - Provider: Npgsql (PostgreSQL)
  - Connection string: `PostgresSQLConnectionString` from `appsettings.json`

## Models & Tables

Below are the EF Core models and the resulting database tables (as generated by migrations/snapshot). Types and nullability are listed as they appear in the migration snapshot (PostgreSQL column types).

### Domain tables

- `Schools`
  - `Id`: uuid, PK
  - `RegistrationNumber`: text, non-null
  - `Name`: text, non-null
  - `Email`: text, non-null
  - `Phone`: text, non-null
  - `Address`: text, non-null
  - `City`: text, non-null
  - `State`: text, non-null
  - `PinCode`: integer, non-null
  - `Subscription`: integer, non-null (default in model = 0)
  - `SubscriptionDate`: date, null
  - `IsSoftDeleted`: boolean, non-null (default in model = false)

- `Announcements`
  - `Id`: uuid, PK
  - `Title`: text, non-null
  - `Detail`: text, non-null
  - `Date`: date, non-null
  - `AnnouncedBy`: text, non-null
  - `SchoolId`: uuid, non-null, FK → `Schools(Id)` ON DELETE CASCADE
  - Index: `IX_Announcements_SchoolId`

- `Teacher` (note: table name is singular)
  - `Id`: uuid, PK
  - `Name`: text, non-null
  - `Email`: text, non-null
  - `JoiningDate`: date, non-null
  - `Phone`: text, non-null
  - `Gender`: integer, non-null (enum stored as int)
  - `Address`: text, non-null
  - `SchoolId`: uuid, non-null, FK → `Schools(Id)` ON DELETE CASCADE
  - `UserId`: uuid, null, FK → `AspNetUsers(Id)`
  - Indexes: `IX_Teacher_SchoolId`, `IX_Teacher_UserId`

- `Classes`
  - `Id`: uuid, PK
  - `Name`: text, non-null
  - `Section`: text, non-null
  - `ClassTeacherId`: uuid, null, FK → `Teacher(Id)`
  - `SchoolId`: uuid, non-null, FK → `Schools(Id)` ON DELETE CASCADE
  - Indexes: `IX_Classes_ClassTeacherId`, `IX_Classes_SchoolId`

  - `FatherName`: text, non-null
  - `MotherName`: text, non-null
  - `Email`: text, non-null
  - `Phone`: text, non-null
  - `StudentId`: uuid, non-null, FK → `Students(Id)` ON DELETE CASCADE
  - Index: `IX_Parents_StudentId`

- `Attendance`
  - `Id`: uuid, PK
  - `Date`: date, non-null
  - `Status`: text, non-null (enum converted to string via model config)
  - `UserId`: uuid, null, FK → `AspNetUsers(Id)`
  - Index: `IX_Attendance_UserId`

Notes detected in `DataContext`:
- Enum conversions:
  - `Attendance.Status` stored as string
  - `Student.Gender` stored as string
- Relationship configuration:
  - `School` → many `ApplicationUser` via `ApplicationUser.SchoolId` with cascade delete
- Potential typo/bug in `DataContext` DbSets: `public DbSet<Teacher> TeacherSubject { get; set; }` should likely be `DbSet<TeacherSubject>` and the entity `TeacherSubject` is missing from the DbContext model/migrations.

## Relationships

High-level relationships derived from models and migrations:

- School 1 — many ApplicationUser (required)
- School 1 — many SchoolClass (required)
- School 1 — many Teacher (required)
- School 1 — many Announcement (required)
- SchoolClass 1 — many Student (required)
- Teacher 0..1 — many SchoolClass as ClassTeacher (optional FK on `Classes.ClassTeacherId`)
- Student 1 — 1 Parents? Actually Parents has FK to Student with no unique constraint → effectively Student 1 — many Parents (likely intended 1:1)
- ApplicationUser 0..1 — many Attendance (optional FK)
- ApplicationUser 0..1 — many Student (optional FK `Students.UserId`)
- ApplicationUser 0..1 — many Teacher (optional FK `Teacher.UserId`)
- Subject: standalone; no relationships represented in migrations
- TeacherSubject: model exists but not included in DbContext/migrations → not present in DB

## Migrations Review

- Migrations folder:
  - `20250911151239_Initial-Creation` (empty designer and migration files) → appears unused/stale.
  - `20250911153607_InitialCreationPg` → defines the full schema above; aligned with `DataContextModelSnapshot`.
- Naming consistency:
  - Suggest using consistent, descriptive migration names (e.g., `InitialCreate_Postgres`) and removing/renaming the empty/unused `Initial-Creation` migration to avoid confusion.
- Model vs Migration mismatches:
  - Entity `TeacherSubject` exists in code but is missing in DbContext DbSets and is not present in migrations. No many-to-many is created for Teacher-Subject-Class assignment.
  - Table `Teacher` is singular while other tables are pluralized (`Students`, `Subjects`, `Classes`). Consider consistent naming.
- Conversion mappings:
  - `Attendance.Status` and `Student.Gender` use `HasConversion<string>()` in `OnModelCreating`. Snapshot shows `Status` and `Gender` as `text` accordingly.
- Delete behaviors:
  - Many FKs are ON DELETE CASCADE (e.g., `AspNetUsers.SchoolId`, `Announcements.SchoolId`, `Classes.SchoolId`, `Students.ClassId`, `Teacher.SchoolId`, `Parents.StudentId`). Ensure this matches business rules.

## Authentication & Roles

- Identity configured in `Program.cs`:
  - `AddIdentity<ApplicationUser, IdentityRole<Guid>>()`
  - `AddEntityFrameworkStores<DataContext>()`
  - `AddDefaultTokenProviders()`
- JWT Authentication:
  - Default scheme: `JwtBearer`
  - Token validation parameters from `Jwt:Issuer`, `Jwt:Audience`, `Jwt:Key`
  - Cookie integration: JWT read from `auth_token` cookie in `JwtBearerEvents.OnMessageReceived`
  - CORS policy `corspolicy` allows `http://localhost:8080`, any method/header, credentials
- Role seeding (`SMSDataContext.Helpers.SeedData.SeedRoles`):
  - Roles: `SuperAdmin`, `Admin`, `Teacher`, `Student`, `Parent`
- AuthController:
  - `register`: Creates user and assigns `model.Role`
  - `login`: Issues JWT with claims: `NameIdentifier`, `Name`, `Jti`, and custom `SchoolId` if present; embeds roles as claims; sets cookie `auth_token`
  - `me`: `[Authorize]` required
  - `logout`: `[Authorize]`; deletes cookie
- Password storage: via ASP.NET Identity `PasswordHash` (OK)
- Token refresh: Not implemented

## Controller Endpoints by Role

Detected `[Authorize]` attributes and role restrictions across controllers:

- `AuthController`
  - GET `api/Auth/me` — `[Authorize]`
  - POST `api/Auth/logout` — `[Authorize]`
  - POST `api/Auth/register` — public
  - POST `api/Auth/login` — public

- `ClassController`
  - GET `api/Class` — `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,Principal,SchoolIncharge")]`
  - GET `api/Class/{id}` — same roles
  - POST `api/Class` — same roles
  - PUT `api/Class/{id}` — same roles
  - DELETE `api/Class/{id}` — same roles

- `TeacherController`
  - GET `api/Teacher` — `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin,Principal,SchoolIncharge")]`
  - GET `api/Teacher/{id}` — public
  - POST `api/Teacher` — `[Authorize]`
  - PUT `api/Teacher/{id}` — public
  - DELETE `api/Teacher/{id}` — public

- `StudentController` (class-level `[Authorize]`)
  - All endpoints require authentication (no role restriction):
    - GET `api/Student`
    - GET `api/Student/{id}`
    - GET `api/Student/GetStudentByClassIdAsync/{classId}`
    - POST `api/Student`
    - PUT `api/Student/{id}`
    - DELETE `api/Student/{id}`

- `AnnouncementController`
  - GET `api/Announcement` — public (but relies on user claims in code; should be `[Authorize]`)
  - GET `api/Announcement/GetAnnouncementByIdAsync/{AnnoucementId}` — public
  - POST `api/Announcement/CreateAnnouncement` — public (uses SchoolId from claims; should be `[Authorize]`)
  - PUT `api/Announcement/{id}` — public
  - DELETE `api/Announcement/{id}` — public

- `AttendanceController`
  - All endpoints public (GET, GET by id, POST, PUT, DELETE)

- `TeacherAttendanceController`
  - All endpoints public (GET all, GET by id, POST create, PUT update, DELETE)

- `SchoolController`
  - All endpoints public (list, search, getById, create, update, delete)

Notes:
- Several endpoints access `User` claims (e.g., Class/Student/Teacher/Announcement) but lack `[Authorize]`. This will fail when no user is authenticated and also presents security risks.
- Roles used in controllers include `Admin`, `Principal`, `SchoolIncharge` — note that these two roles (`Principal`, `SchoolIncharge`) are NOT part of seeded roles. Requests will never satisfy those roles unless manually created elsewhere.

## Review & Suggestions

### Schema and Modeling
- Consistency: Table naming mixes plural (`Students`, `Classes`) and singular (`Teacher`). Prefer consistent pluralization.
- Missing entity mapping: `TeacherSubject` exists in code but is not registered in `DataContext` (DbSet missing) and absent from migrations. As a result, there is no persisted assignment of Teachers to Subjects and Classes.
- Parent-Student relationship: `Parents.StudentId` suggests many parents per student, but many systems model one (or two) parent rows per student. If intended 1:1 or 1:2, enforce with a unique index on `Parents.StudentId` or split into separate `Parent` and junction table.
- Enum storage: `Student.Gender` stored as `text`, `Teacher.Gender` stored as `int`. Standardize (strings are more readable but larger; ints are compact but require mapping). Choose one consistently.
- Cascade deletes: Deleting a `School` cascades to `AspNetUsers`, `Classes`, `Teacher`, `Announcements`. Ensure this matches business rules; accidental school deletion will nuke all related data.

### Indexes and Constraints
- Add unique indexes where data requires uniqueness:
  - `Schools.RegistrationNumber` likely unique
  - `Students` may require composite uniqueness `(ClassId, RollNumber)` or unique `SRNumber`
  - `Teacher.Email`, `Student.Email` likely unique per school
- Foreign key indexes exist (created by EF). Consider additional filtered/covering indexes for frequent queries.

### Migrations and DataContext
- Remove/rollback the empty migration `20250911151239_Initial-Creation` to reduce confusion.
- Register `DbSet<TeacherSubject>` and configure relationships for many-to-many (Teacher-Subject-Classes). Create a dedicated migration.
- Fix `DataContext` property typo: `DbSet<Teacher> TeacherSubject` → `DbSet<TeacherSubject> TeacherSubjects`.
- Consider fluent configuration classes (IEntityTypeConfiguration<>) per entity to keep `OnModelCreating` maintainable.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Secrets: `Jwt:Key` and Postgres password are stored in `appsettings.json`. Move to Secret Manager or environment variables and do not commit secrets.
- Cookies: JWT is stored in `auth_token` with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=None` — good for cross-site dev; in production consider domain scoping and HTTPS-only.
- Refresh tokens: Not implemented. Add refresh token storage and rotation to avoid frequent re-login and improve security.
- Role alignment: Controllers use roles `Admin, Principal, SchoolIncharge`, but seeding includes `SuperAdmin, Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent`. Add missing roles to seeding or update controllers to use seeded roles.
- Authorization gaps: Many controllers are fully public but rely on user claims inside actions. Add `[Authorize]` (and appropriate roles) consistently.

### Potential Bugs / Risks
- `AnnouncementController` and others read `User` claims without `[Authorize]` → `User` may be unauthenticated, leading to null/claims parsing issues and unauthorized data access.
- `TeacherController` PUT/DELETE are public.
- `TeacherSubject` entity not mapped → features relying on it will not persist.
- Mixed enum storage types for `Gender` creates confusion and migration churn if changed later.

## Next Actions

1. Secure endpoints: Add `[Authorize]` (and roles) to all controllers that read `User` claims; make `SchoolController`, `AttendanceController`, `AnnouncementController`, `TeacherAttendanceController`, and Teacher CRUD endpoints require proper roles.
2. Align roles: Update role seeding to include `Principal` and `SchoolIncharge`, or refactor controllers to use only seeded roles; add policy-based authorization for finer control.
3. Map `TeacherSubject`: Add `DbSet<TeacherSubject>` to `DataContext`, configure relationships (Teacher 1—many, Subject 1—many, Class 1—many or many-to-many as needed), and create a migration; add indexes (TeacherId, SubjectId, SchoolClassId) and uniqueness constraints as appropriate.
4. Harden schema: Add unique indexes (e.g., `Schools.RegistrationNumber`, `Students.SRNumber`, `Students(ClassId, RollNumber)`, `Teacher.Email`), standardize enum storage (string or int), and fix table naming consistency (pluralize `Teacher`).
5. Secrets and tokens: Move connection string/password and `Jwt:Key` to environment/secret storage, implement refresh tokens with rotation and revoke on logout, and add token lifetime/clock skew configuration suitable for production.

## Comprehensive Review & Feedback

### 🎯 Overall Assessment: **B+ (Good with Critical Issues)**

The database structure shows solid foundational work with ASP.NET Core Identity integration and proper EF Core setup. However, there are several critical security and consistency issues that need immediate attention.

---

### 📊 **Database Design Review**

#### ✅ **Strengths:**
- **Good Identity Integration**: Proper use of ASP.NET Core Identity with GUID keys
- **Clean Entity Relationships**: Logical parent-child relationships between School → Classes → Students
- **Proper Cascade Deletes**: Appropriate cascade behavior for data integrity
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Good choice for production scalability
- **Comprehensive ER Diagram**: Well-documented relationships with Mermaid diagram

#### ❌ **Critical Issues:**
- **Missing TeacherSubject Entity**: This is a major gap - teachers can't be assigned to subjects/classes
- **Inconsistent Table Naming**: Mix of singular (`Teacher`) and plural (`Students`, `Classes`) table names
- **Enum Storage Inconsistency**: `Student.Gender` as string vs `Teacher.Gender` as int
- **Missing Unique Constraints**: No uniqueness on critical fields like `Schools.RegistrationNumber`

#### 🔧 **Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate**: Fix the `TeacherSubject` entity mapping in DataContext

## Risks

- Secrets in `appsettings.json` → Move to env/secret store.
- Overly permissive CORS → Restrict per environment.
- N+1 queries → Use projections/Include; add indices.
- Missing idempotency → Enforce unique constraints (attendance).

## Next actions
- Add API versioning and `/health` with Npgsql check.
- Externalize JWT/DB secrets; tighten CORS per environment.
- Implement rate limiting and consistent ProblemDetails across controllers.

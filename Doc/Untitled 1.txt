## Risks

- CORS or cookie misconfiguration causing silent auth failures → verify `withCredentials` and SameSite attributes with HTTPS.
- Stale cache rendering outdated data → set sensible `staleTime` and use invalidation on mutations.
- Large bundles → audit with `vite-bundle-visualizer`, code split aggressively.

## Next actions
- Implement API base URL and HTTP client wrapper with CSRF header for writes.
- Add route guards and role-aware navigation.
- Configure React Query (QueryClient) with sane defaults and devtools in development.

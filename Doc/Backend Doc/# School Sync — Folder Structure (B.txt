# School Sync — Folder Structure (Backend)

A maintainable, testable layout for the ASP.NET Core 8 solution with clean separation of concerns, DI, and test projects. Optimized for EF Core with PostgreSQL, Identity, Swagger, and layered architecture.

---

## Principles
- Separation of concerns: API (controllers) ↔ Services ↔ Repositories ↔ DataContext ↔ Database.
- Testability: small units, clear interfaces, isolated tests (unit/integration/database).
- Explicit contracts: DTOs and AutoMapper profiles live in a shared models project.
- Conventions over configuration: consistent naming, consistent DI lifetimes.
